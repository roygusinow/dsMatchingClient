\usage{
ds.avg_compute(
  fit,
  data,
  treatment,
  estimand = "ATE",
  error_type = NULL,
  clusters = NULL,
  eps = 1e-07,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A list. Output from a `ds.glm` model. Must contain required elements like the formula and coefficients.}

\item{data}{A character string. The name of the data frame stored on the server side.}

\item{treatment}{A character string. The name of the treatment variable within `data`.}

\item{estimand}{A character string specifying the estimand to compute. One of `"ATE"`, `"ATT"`, or `"ATC"`. Default is `"ATE"`.}

\item{error_type}{A character string indicating the HC-type estimator to correct bias (e.g., `"HC0"`, `"HC1"`, etc.).
If `NULL`, standard errors are not returned.}

\item{clusters}{A factor vector indicating cluster membership (e.g., subclass assignments). Typically obtained via `ds.matchit`.}

\item{eps}{A numeric value for the finite difference step size used in Jacobian approximation. Default is `1e-7`.}

\item{datasources}{A list of `DSConnection-class` objects. If `NULL`, will attempt to find active connections via `datashield.connections_find()`.}
}
\value{
A named list with at least:
\describe{
  \item{estimate}{The computed average treatment effect.}
  \item{se}{(Optional) The standard error of the estimate, if `error_type` is provided.}
}
}
\description{
Compute Average Treatment Effects (ATE, ATT, ATC) with Optional Standard Errors
}
\details{
This function wraps internal client-side calls to compute treatment effects and, optionally, robust standard errors.
It is part of the `dsMatchingClient` workflow and expects GLM models fitted using `ds.glm`.
