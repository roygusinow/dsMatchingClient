}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A list. Output from a `ds.glm` model. Must contain required elements like the formula and coefficients.}

\item{data}{A character string. The name of the data frame stored on the server side.}

\item{treatment}{A character string. The name of the treatment variable within `data`.}

\item{estimand}{A character string specifying the estimand to compute. One of `"ATE"`, `"ATT"`, or `"ATC"`. Default is `"ATE"`.}

\item{comparison}{A character string indicating the type of comparison. One of `"difference"` (default), `"lnriskratio"`, or `"lnoddsratio"`.}

\item{error_type}{A character string indicating the HC-type estimator to correct bias (e.g., `"HC0"`, `"HC1"`, etc.).
If `NULL`, standard errors are not returned.}

\item{clusters}{A factor vector indicating cluster membership (e.g., subclass assignments). Typically obtained via `ds.matchit`.}

\item{eps}{A numeric value for the finite difference step size used in Jacobian approximation. Default is `1e-7`.}

\item{datasources}{A list of `DSConnection-class` objects. If `NULL`, will attempt to find active connections via `datashield.connections_find()`.}
}
\value{
A named list with at least:
\describe{
  \item{estimate}{The computed average treatment effect.}
  \item{se}{(Optional) The standard error of the estimate, if `error_type` is provided.}
}

Compute Average Treatment Effects (ATE, ATT, ATC) with Optional Standard Errors

\details{
This function wraps internal client-side calls to compute treatment effects and, optionally, robust standard errors.
It is part of the `dsMatchingClient` workflow and expects GLM models fitted using `ds.glm`.

After the propensity score matching procedure has been conducted, there exist
\eqn{H} subclassification strata (or matched groups) distributed across \eqn{S}
remote servers. The average treatment effect (ATE) can be written as

\deqn{
\widehat{ATE}\left(X; \widehat{\beta}_{ATE}\right)
=
\sum_{s=1}^{S}
\sum_{h=1}^{H}
\sum_{i=1}^{n_{s,h,d}}
w^{*}_{s,h,d,i}
\left(
\widehat{y}_{s,h,d=1,i}
-
\widehat{y}_{s,h,d=0,i}
\right)
}

where \eqn{\widehat{y}_{ij} = Y_i \mid X_i, D_i = j} denotes the predicted outcome
for the \eqn{i}-th sample conditional on covariates \eqn{X_i} and treatment status
\eqn{j}. The corresponding weight is defined as

\deqn{
w^{*}_{s,h,d,i}
=
\frac{n_{s,d}}{N_d}
\frac{n_{s,h,d}}{n_{s,d}}
\frac{w_{s,h,d,i}}{n_{s,h,d}}
}

and depends on the number of samples within each stratum \eqn{h} and server
\eqn{s}, as well as on the matching procedure used to generate
\eqn{w_{s,h,d,i}}.

The two innermost summations can be aggregated locally on each server prior to
communication with the central client. Consequently, only a weighted ATE from
each of the \eqn{S} remote servers is required to compute the global ATE estimate.
