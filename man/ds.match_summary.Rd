\title{This function generates a covariate balance summary table before and after matching.
It compares covariate distributions between treated and control groups using empirical
cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), with optional binning and summary type.}
\usage{
ds.match_summary(
  unmatched_obj,
  matched_obj,
  type = "combine",
  bin_num = 40,
  treatment = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unmatched_obj}{A character string. The name of the unmatched (original) server-side data frame.}

\item{matched_obj}{A character string. The name of the matched server-side data frame produced by matching (e.g., `ds.matchit`).}

\item{type}{A character string. The type of summary to return: `"split"` for study-wise results or `"combined"` for pooled summaries. Default is `"combine"`.}

\item{bin_num}{An integer. Number of bins to use in ECDF binning. Default is `40`.}

\item{treatment}{A character string. The name of the treatment variable in the server-side data.}

\item{datasources}{A list of `DSConnection-class` objects. If `NULL`, the function uses `datashield.connections_find()` to detect active connections.}
}
\value{
A named list containing covariate balance summaries. Includes pre- and post-matching comparisons
for each covariate and a sample size table with matched and unmatched counts.
}
\description{
This function generates a covariate balance summary table before and after matching.
It compares covariate distributions between treated and control groups using empirical
cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), with optional binning and summary type.
}
\details{
This function is used to evaluate balance in observed covariates between treated and control units
before and after matching in federated DataSHIELD settings. Factor and character variables are excluded.
Balance is assessed via ECDF-based summaries using binning across a range pooled across all studies.
