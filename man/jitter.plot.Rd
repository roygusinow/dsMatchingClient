\alias{jitter.plot}
\title{This function creates jittered dot plots of propensity score distributions
for treated and control units, before and after matching. It provides a visual
comparison of how the distributions align across groups.}
\usage{
jitter.plot(match)
}
\arguments{
\item{match}{A list. The result of a `ds.match_summary()` call.}
}
\value{
A faceted `ggplot` grid combining four panels:
\itemize{
  \item Unmatched Treated Units
  \item Matched Treated Units
  \item Matched Control Units
  \item Unmatched Control Units
}
Each panel shows a jittered horizontal layout of propensity scores.

\description{
This function creates jittered dot plots of propensity score distributions
for treated and control units, before and after matching. It provides a visual
comparison of how the distributions align across groups.
}
\details{
This function visualizes the overlap of propensity scores between treated and control
groups, before and after matching. Treated and control units are plotted separately,
with jitter applied to reduce overplotting. It helps assess the quality of matching
in terms of covariate overlap.

**Server-side functions called**:
\itemize{
  \item None. This is a client-side visualization function using only local match output.
