\title{plotting functions which don't require calls to the servers
only matched summary tables required
This function creates a Love plot to visualize standardized mean differences before and after matching.
It highlights the balance improvement for each covariate in a concise and interpretable way.}
\usage{
love.plot(match_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{match_obj}{A list. The output from `ds.match_summary()`,
containing both unmatched and matched summary tables.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing side-by-side standardized mean differences for each covariate
across unmatched and matched samples.

plotting functions which don't require calls to the servers
only matched summary tables required
This function creates a Love plot to visualize standardized mean differences before and after matching.
It highlights the balance improvement for each covariate in a concise and interpretable way.
}
\details{
This function extracts balance summary tables before and after matching, reshapes the data for plotting,
and generates a Love plot using `ggplot2`. It assumes that the tables include a `Std.Mean.Diff` column
and named rows corresponding to covariates.

**Server-side functions called**:
\itemize{
  \item None. This is a purely client-side visualization function.
