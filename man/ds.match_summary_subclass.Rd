\title{This function generates subclass-specific covariate balance summaries after matching.
It compares covariate distributions between treated and control groups for each subclass,
optionally reporting percent improvements relative to the unmatched sample.}
\usage{
ds.match_summary_subclass(
  unmatched_obj,
  matched_obj,
  detailed = F,
  bin_num = 40,
  treatment,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unmatched_obj}{A character string. The name of the unmatched (original) server-side data frame.}

\item{matched_obj}{A character string. The name of the matched server-side data frame that contains subclass assignments.}

\item{detailed}{A logical value. Whether to return percent improvements in balance measures (standardized mean difference, variance ratio, ECDF maximum) for each subclass. Default is `FALSE`.}

\item{bin_num}{An integer. Number of bins to use in ECDF binning. Default is `40`.}

\item{treatment}{A character string. The name of the treatment variable in the server-side data.}

\item{datasources}{A list of `DSConnection-class` objects. If `NULL`, the function uses `datashield.connections_find()` to detect active connections.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
  \item{Summary}{A nested list with summaries for unmatched data and each matched subclass.}
  \item{Percent Balance Improvement (optional)}{If `detailed = TRUE`, includes percent change in balance metrics relative to unmatched data.}
  \item{Sample Sizes}{A table showing the number of treated and control units in each subclass.}
}
}
\description{
This function generates subclass-specific covariate balance summaries after matching.
It compares covariate distributions between treated and control groups for each subclass,
optionally reporting percent improvements relative to the unmatched sample.
}
\details{
This function allows for fine-grained diagnostics of covariate balance after subclassification-based
matching in a federated DataSHIELD setting. It bins covariates using pooled ranges across studies
and excludes non-numeric or categorical variables.
