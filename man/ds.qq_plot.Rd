\title{This function generates quantile-quantile (QQ) plots comparing the distributions of covariates
between treated and control units, both before and after matching.}
\usage{
ds.qq_plot(
  unmatched = "DST",
  matched = "matched_pooled",
  formula = NULL,
  datasources = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unmatched}{A character string. The name of the unmatched (pre-matching) data frame stored on the server.}

\item{matched}{A character string. The name of the matched data frame stored on the server.}

\item{formula}{A formula object. Specifies the treatment variable on the left-hand side, and covariates to compare on the right-hand side.}

\item{datasources}{A list of `DSConnection-class` objects. If `NULL`, the function uses `datashield.connections_find()` to detect active connections.}
}
\value{
A combined `ggplot` object consisting of side-by-side QQ plots for each covariate, comparing treated vs control units in the unmatched and matched datasets.
}
\description{
This function generates quantile-quantile (QQ) plots comparing the distributions of covariates
between treated and control units, both before and after matching.
}
\details{
For each covariate, the function creates QQ plots of treated vs control distributions,
before and after matching. It subsets the data by treatment status server-side using
`ds.dataFrameSubset`, and compares covariate distributions using empirical quantiles
aggregated with `ds.quantile`.

**Server-side functions called**:
\itemize{
  \item None, but uses `ds.dataFrameSubset` to create subsets of treated and control units.
